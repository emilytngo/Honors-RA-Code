     ##notes from running with SC+treatment and taking out demo differences
     #when we take out our demographic differences by taking out first gen and transfers in both groups, we see a sig main effect of SC on PS (as SC goes up, PS goes up by 0.2***). However, we see the two-way interaction with treatment (that is students being in our treatment group), this main effect goes away, and we see that as SC increases, PS decreases by -0.15 (p<0.05)
     #with more mentorship and connections, your PS goes down if you're enrolled in BC
